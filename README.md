# Habitica Auto-Potion
Send reminders to your Pushbullet account when your Habitica character is pretty darn close to dying. A tool for those of us who consistently forget to mark completed dailies and in doing so, painfully and stupidly die.

## Getting Started (TODO: update this...)
1. Download necessary modules from `requirements.txt` using `pip`(TODO: a grand total of probably 5 from this list are actually needed...)
2. Update API credentials in `config.py`
3. `python app.py` and you're good to go!

## Acknowledgements
- Final Fantasy for the clever name for a side project
- My underdeveloped memory for necessitating this
